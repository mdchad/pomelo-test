# React + TypeScript + Styled-Components + TailwindCSS Boilerplate

> Boilerplate for getting started with a TypeScript based React ([CRA](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app)) project with Tailwind and Styled-Components. Also includes editorconfig, prettier and HMR.

This is the setup I used to start an old project of mine using these technologies. There were no tutorials available on the Internet so it took some time to get up and running. I hope this repository helps anyone looking to use the same tech.

**Check out the [commits](https://github.com/aviaryan/react-typescript-tailwind-styled-components/commits/master) to understand individual steps.**

### Running the project

```sh
yarn start
```
